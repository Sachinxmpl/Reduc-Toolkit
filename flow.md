## Why Redux ?
- For state management reducing porp drillling 
- For easy debugging
- Centralized state: Keeps all application data in one place, making it easier to track and manage.

Redux Toolkit is a set of opinionated and standardised tools that simplify application development using the Redux state management library.


## Why Redux Toolkit over Redux 
- Deining reducer , with Reduc Toolkit you can specify a slice with a few lines of codes to define a reducer instead of defining actions and reduces separately like in Redux 
- Redux toolkit included built-in middleware that can handle common tasks like asynchronous code and optimizing performance.
- Redux toolkit includes integration with the Redux DevTools browser extension which makes it easier to bebug and analyse 


Store 
- Separate place to store all variables / data 

Reducers 
- Only functions through which we can change the state of variables 

State
- state defines the current state of varaibles inside the reducers 

Action 
- Action acts like the trigger to the reducers functions
